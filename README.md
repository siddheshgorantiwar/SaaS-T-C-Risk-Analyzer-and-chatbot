# SaaS T&C Risk Analyzer and Chatbot

## Overview

The SaaS T&C Risk Analyzer and Chatbot is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze SaaS Terms and Conditions (T&C) for potential risks and provide actionable insights. The tool leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with FAISS vector search and **binary quantization** to make queries ultra-fast and memory-efficient. Users interact with a chatbot ("Janie") to ask rich, context-aware questions about uploaded T&C documents.

***

## Features

- **Risk Analysis**: 
    - Analyzes uploaded SaaS T&C PDFs, identifying potential risks in areas like data ownership, SLAs, liability, termination, privacy, and more.
    - Delivers recommendations with references to relevant T&C clauses.
- **Agentic Chatbot**: 
    - "Janie" uses RAG, retrieving the most relevant clauses or sections via FAISS and binary quantization for each question.
    - Combines retrieval with LLM-powered reasoning for high-accuracy, cited answers.
- **Binary Quantization & FAISS**:
    - Embedding vectors from T&C chunks are compressed from float32 to 1-bit binary signatures.
    - Results in a ~32x reduction in memory usage and 20–40x faster retrieval for question-answering ([see benchmarking in recent research](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization)).
    - Enables efficient handling of large T&C documents or corpora directly in memory.
- **PDF Support & Configurable Chunking**:
    - Users can upload PDF files; the document is chunked, embedded, and indexed with FAISS.
    - Chunk size and overlap are configurable in the UI.
- **Streaming Chat & Citations**:
    - Chatbot provides cited answers referencing top-matching document chunks.
    - Optional UI displays exact retrievals for transparency.

## Setup and Configuration

1. **API Key**: 
    - Get a free API key from Groq at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). Enter your key in the sidebar before use.
2. **Upload SaaS T&C PDF**: 
    - Use the file uploader to add your T&C document for analysis.
3. **Configure Embedding Options**:
    - Choose to enable binary quantization (on by default for maximum speed/memory efficiency).
    - Adjust chunk size and overlap to optimize context granularity.

***

## Usage

1. **Analyze T&C**:
    - Upload a PDF, configure chunking/binary quantization.
    - Click "Process Document" to create the FAISS index.
    - Review automatically extracted risks and recommendations from the document.
2. **Agentic Chat**:
    - Enter questions about the T&C in the chat box.
    - Janie will retrieve relevant clauses using binary-quantized FAISS search and provide accurate, context-rich answers.
    - Toggle the option to see retrieved chunks for full transparency.

***

## Technical Approach

- **Binary Quantization**:
    - Float32 embeddings from document chunks (via Sentence Transformers or similar) are thresholded to 1s/0s and packed into bits (`np.packbits(where(vec>=0, 1, 0))`).
    - This shrinks memory footprint and makes vector search ~32x faster using Hamming distance in FAISS.
    - Retrieval accuracy is comparable to full-precision search (see [HuggingFace embedding quantization](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization) and [Qdrant binary quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/binary-quantization/)).
- **FAISS Vector Index**:
    - For small T&C sets, uses `IndexBinaryFlat` for exact, fast retrieval.
    - Multiple T&Cs can be indexed and compared if needed.
- **ReAct Agentic RAG**:
    - The chat agent uses a retrieval tool provided via LangChain's ToolNode.
    - The agent reasons about the query, retrieves supporting evidence, and synthesizes a useful, cited answer using a powerful model (e.g., Llama3-70B from Groq).

***

## Example

1. **Analyzing T&C**:
    - Input: “The company may terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice.”
    - Output: Identifies possible risk in the termination clause, with citation and recommendations.

2. **Chat with Janie**:
    - Query: “What are the data ownership rights in this T&C?”
    - Response: Janie returns the most relevant chunks, then answers clearly, referencing exact clause locations.

***

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Make sure your Groq API key is correct and entered before use.
- **Document Issues**: Only valid PDF files are supported. If you're seeing processing errors, try using a simpler document or adjusting chunk size.
- **Binary Quantization**: By default, binary quantization is enabled for best memory and speed. If you wish to compare with full-float embeddings, disable it in settings.
- **Performance**: For very large documents, binary quantization ensures efficient retrieval and prevents memory issues.

# SaaS T&C Risk Analyzer and Chatbot

## Overview

The SaaS T&C Risk Analyzer and Chatbot is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze SaaS Terms and Conditions (T&C) for potential risks and provide actionable insights. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), using **FAISS vector search with binary quantization** for ultra-fast and memory-efficient document retrieval. The chatbot (“Janie”) can answer questions about the T&C with evidence-backed responses.

## Features

- **Risk Analysis**:  
  Parses uploaded SaaS T&C documents, identifies potential risks (data ownership, liability, SLAs, termination, and more), and cites the relevant clauses for each recommendation.

- **Agentic Chatbot with RAG**:  
  Conversational Q&A over the analyzed T&C. Janie uses RAG: user questions trigger retrieval of the top matching document chunks based on embeddings, enhanced by LLM reasoning.  

- **Binary Quantization for Embeddings**:  
  Embeddings are compressed from float32 to 1-bit signatures using sign-thresholding (`np.packbits`). This reduces memory ~32x and makes vector search >20x faster; see [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization) and [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/binary-quantization/).

- **Configurable Chunking & Upload**:  
  Upload any T&C PDF, select chunk size/overlap, and toggle quantization for flexibility and speed.

## Setup and Configuration

1. **API Key**:  
   Obtain a free Groq API key ([console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)), enter it in the sidebar.

2. **PDF Upload**:  
   Use the file uploader to select and process your SaaS T&C document.

3. **Parameters**:  
   Adjust chunk size, overlap, and enable binary quantization (default: on) for best performance.

## Usage

1. **Document Analysis**:
   - Upload your PDF.
   - Click "Process Document" to index.
   - View risks and recommendations, with citations.

2. **Agentic Chat**:
   - Ask “Janie” questions about the T&C.
   - Answers cite retrieved clauses; toggle to view supporting text.

## Binary Quantization Technical Approach

- Float32 embeddings from chunked text are converted to binary (0/1) per-dimension.
- Chunks are indexed with FAISS's `IndexBinaryFlat` (exact, fast) or IVF for larger collections.
- All semantic retrieval for answering questions uses binary search (Hamming distance), vastly increasing speed and scalability.
- Extraction quality is backed by recent research showing near-identical recall for risk/Q&A tasks compared to full precision.

## Assumptions and Design Considerations

- **Large Document Support**: Binary quantization enables handling much larger T&Cs (thousands of clauses) without memory bottlenecks.
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: Hamming distance over binary vectors is mathematically well-aligned with cosine similarity of original embeddings; see [research](https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization).
- **Performance**: All retrieval is ~32x smaller in memory and ~20–40x faster than standard float32 vector search.
- **Extensible**: The approach supports indexing multiple documents for cross-document risk comparison.

## Example

1. **Analyzing T&C**:  
   - Input: “The company may terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice.”  
   - Output: Flags termination clauses, highlights risks, provides actionable, cited recommendations.

2. **Chat with Janie**:  
   - Query: “What data ownership risks does this T&C have?”  
   - Response: Cited answer referencing precise matched clauses using fast binary RAG search.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key**: Confirm validity; enter before analysis.
- **Document Size**: Binary quantization prevents crashes even with large T&Cs.
- **Quantization Toggle**: For benchmarking or research, test with quantization OFF for full precision.
- **Errors**: Check for non-PDF uploads, missing API keys, or session resets.
